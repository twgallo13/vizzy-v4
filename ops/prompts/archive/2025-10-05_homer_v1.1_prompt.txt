[HOMER v1.1] Set up Prompts Ledger, backfill v1.0, merge PR #1, boot dev, and report URL.

RULES
- I am not a developer. Perform ALL git and code steps for me automatically.
- Record THIS PROMPT‚ÄôS FULL TEXT in the repo.
- Summarize your work in the repo too.
- Do not ask questions; do the work and report the results.

STEPS
1) Git prep
   - pkill -f vite || true
   - git fetch --all --prune
   - git checkout main
   - git pull --rebase origin main

2) Create a Prompts Ledger
   - Create folders:
       ops/prompts/archive
   - Create/append ops/prompts/PROMPTS_LOG.md with sections:
       # Prompts Ledger
       - An index table: Date | Agent | Version | Branch/PR | Prompt File | Summary File
   - For the PREVIOUS run (Homer v1.0 ‚Äì audit & scaffolds that opened PR #1):
       - Write the full prompt text you received from me (the ‚Äúautopilot‚Äù audit/scaffold prompt) to:
           ops/prompts/archive/2025-10-05_homer_v1.0_prompt.txt
       - Write your summary (the output you posted that lists the branch, changes, and PR URL) to:
           ops/prompts/archive/2025-10-05_homer_v1.0_summary.md
       - Add an index row to PROMPTS_LOG.md pointing to those two files and to PR #1.

   - For THIS run (Homer v1.1):
       - Save THIS prompt text to:
           ops/prompts/archive/2025-10-05_homer_v1.1_prompt.txt
       - Create an empty summary placeholder:
           ops/prompts/archive/2025-10-05_homer_v1.1_summary.md
         (You will fill it in at the end.)

3) Merge PR #1 (audit fixes)
   - If there is an open PR #1, merge it with a merge commit (not squash), then:
       - git pull --rebase origin main
       - Create a tag: git tag -a audit-fixes-v1 -m "Audit fixes batch 1"
       - git push origin --tags
   - If PR #1 is already merged, skip merge and still create the tag if not present.

4) Start dev server in DEMO mode
   - Ensure apps/web/.env.local has:
       VITE_ENV=dev
       VITE_USE_MOCKS=1
   - Start: npm run dev -w apps/web &
   - Detect the forwarded port and produce the Codespaces preview URL.
   - Append ?role=admin&demo=1 to the URL.

5) Fill in THIS run‚Äôs summary file
   - Write to ops/prompts/archive/2025-10-05_homer_v1.1_summary.md:
       - Date/time (UTC)
       - What you merged/tagged
       - Dev server port
       - Exact preview URL with ?role=admin&demo=1
       - Quick verification checklist results:
         [x] /assignments and /assignment both work
         [x] route_view telemetry firing on navigation
         [x] mocks active (no Firebase calls)
   - Append a new row for v1.1 to ops/prompts/PROMPTS_LOG.md with links to the prompt + summary.

6) Commit and push
   - git add ops/prompts
   - git commit -m "Prompts Ledger: add v1.0 backfill and v1.1 entry; merge+tag; dev URL"
   - git push
